1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,680
It has been said...

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,780
Through the ages...

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,520
Without sacrifice...

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,860
There can be no victory.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,080
Two species at war.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,360
One flesh.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,800
One metal.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,560
Optimus Prime has left us.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,700
One hundred billion trillion planets in the cosmos.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,440
You want to know don't you?

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,820
Why they keep coming here?

12
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,940
I wanna stay.

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,760
And I wanna fight them!

14
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,940
And now... Two worlds colliding.

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,780
The operation is over!

16
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,060
We're not giving up, okay?

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,340
Only one survives.

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,860
Oh my God.

19
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,840
Forgive me.
